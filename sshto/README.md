# SSHTO

This is a simple script that allows you to easily SSH into pre-specified instances.

## How to use
1. Download the file and add into one of your $PATH locations.
	a. I personally put my scripts within a folder I made at `~/bin`. Then add the new path to /etc/paths [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7703041/editing-path-variable-on-mac)
2. Might need to restart your console.
3. Run script by typing `sshto <command>`
